# Hack-Assembler
Assembler for the hack language
As per the NAND2Tetris course specifications, this is an assembler for the hack machine language. 
This converts a .asm file to a .hack file that can be runned on a hack machine.

# How to run
As the assembler never made it out of the prototype stage, the directory to convert has not been implemented. So...

1) Head into the Assembler.java file and change the path variable under the main method to the location with the .asm file
2) Compile the java files and run the program. 

# Future Possibility
Implement this as a command line tool... maybe
